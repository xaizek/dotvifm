## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xaizek/dotvifm.git ~/.vifm
```

## Machine-specific configuration

All local settings should be placed in `~/.vifm/vifmrc_local` file, which is
assumed to exist.  It might be empty, but it's better to have it anyway as it
prevents vifm from displaying errors on the status bar.
